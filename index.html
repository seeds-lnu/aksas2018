									  <p>Self-adaptation is widely considered as an effective approach for allowing systems to deal with uncertainty and achieve requirements in a changing environment. Self-adaptive systems typically consist of a managed subsystem that implements the system functionality and a managing subsystem that implements the adaptation logic. Several processes, methods, practices and tools for building self-adaptive systems have been proposed from both academia and industry that constitutes a body of knowledge. This knowledge should be packaged as a toolkit for designers facing a self-adaptive systems. In fact, during the design process, several decisions about the managing and the managed systems are taken. These decisions, and the rationale behind them, is an important knowledge source that should be reused in other contexts. The principal challenge is that this knowledge is often unstructured and not properly classified to support systematic knowledge reuse. This prevent practitioners to leverage on previous knowledge. Therefore, all design choices are known and thus decisions are based on incomplete information. Thus, decisions are primarily driven by previous experience, rather than a result from a systematic decision approach.
									  </p>
									  <p>
To this extent, this Workshop aims at establish Architectural Knowledge about self-adaptive systems by collecting and organising, experiences and practices from practitioners in industry and academia. Specifically, the purpose of this Workshop is to create a forum for (i) proposing, discussing, evaluating, sharing, and classifying design/architectural artifacts and (ii) distilling a shared Architectural Knowledge for self-adaptive systems.
</p>
									  <p>The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<ul>
									    <li>Comparison and evaluation of reference architectures for self-adaptive systems
<li>Modelling languages to represent self-adaptive systems</li>
<li>Architecture Description Languages for Self-adaptive Systems</li>
<li>Architectural artefacts for self-adaptive systems</li>
<li>Knowledge on architectural patterns for building self-adaptive systems</li>
<li>Modelling of adaptation strategies, tactics, or policies</li>
<li>Structuring knowledge and fostering reuse of adaptation strategies and tactics</li>
<li>Knowledge models of self-adaptive systems for reutilization in different domains</li>
<li>Architectural decision making when building self-adaptive systems</li>
<li>Knowledge evaluation and reuse on monitoring and data acquisition</li>
<li>Knowledge evaluation and reuse on deliberation, planning and decision of architectural changes</li>
<li>Knowledge on actuation on the system</li>
<li>Knowledge on the communication between architectural elements, and between managing and managed systems
<li>Knowledge on measuring and evaluating self-adaptive systems</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h3>Submission:</h3>
<p>
Papers should be submitted to EasyChair (<a
href="https://easychair.org">https://easychair.org</a>) as a single
PDF file. The maximum length for papers is 6 pages in ACM style (see formatting instructions at <a
href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>). 
</p>
<p>
Submissions will be selected based on their relevance, quality, soundness and potential to develop discussion during the workshop.
The ECSA 2018 workshop proceedings will be published by ACM.
